## Use Cases

![diagram of the use cases for various roles in the marketplace system](./_assets/use-case-diagram.png)

### Unregistered Users

The only action unregistered users (i.e. users without an active account) can take is to **create an account** in the system. Users are not able to interact with any of the core features of the platform until they have created an account.

### Registered Users

Once a user has an account, they are able to access the core features of the site.

Registered users can perform all of the following actions.

#### Log in

This is the first action a registered user will take when visiting the platform. In the same way that unregistered users cannot access any features of the site until they create an account and log in, users who already have an account still must log in before gaining access to the platform.
